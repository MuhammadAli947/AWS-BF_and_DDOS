# AWS-BF_and_DDOS
This script was used to automate the aws cognito calls for autentication and otp generation if 2FA is added. The first call uses the client ID to get session token and put it in the second call then uses the second call to initiate the OTP for 2FA. Can be used for security Audit and DDOS attack as well against AWS cognito
